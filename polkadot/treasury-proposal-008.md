(*) [Re-Denomination DOT](https://polkadot.network/the-results-are-in/)
### Appendix: Exchange rate EUR/DOT
The Social Contract states that the DOT* base-price will be determined by taking a 30 day average price from major exchanges. 
Currently DOT* has not been traded on exchanges long enough to determine a 30 day average price. 
Hence there is currently no good method to determine fair value of DOT*.
