### Appendix: Exchange rate EUR/DOT (old)
The Social Contract states that the DOT base-price will be determined by taking a 30 day average price from major exchanges. 
Currently DOT (old)* has not been traded on exchanges long enough to determine a 30 day average price. 
Hence there is currently no good method to determine fair value of DOT (old)*. 
The lowest EUR/DOT (old) trading price on exchanges is ~240 EUR/DOT (old). [Source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot-old)

Two treasury proposal (1 & 2) were submitted to the Polkadot Treasury when there was more uncertainty about the DOT valuation.
We have taken new exchange valuation into account and will drop our funding request of treasury proposal 1.
We maintain our funding request for treasury proposal 2, changing this proposal 2 into the a proposal for 6 months of service for polkascan.io.
Effectively this cuts the requested funding in half, making the DOT exchange rate of: 211.56 EUR/DOT (old)*.
