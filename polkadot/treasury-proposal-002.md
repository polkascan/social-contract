### Appendix: Exchange rate EUR/DOT
(*) [Pre Re-Denomination DOTs](https://polkadot.network/the-results-are-in/)
The Social Contract states that DOT base-price will be determined by taking an 30 day average price from major exchanges. Currently DOTs are not traded on exchanges.
Hence there is currently no official method to determine fair value of DOT.
The used exchange rate in this treasury proposal is based on a report of a recent private sale according to this [source](https://www.coindesk.com/polkadot-raises-43m-in-72-hour-private-sale-source).
The exchange is determined as: 125 USD/DOT. 
[EUR|USD](https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/EUR-USD-13_08_2020-exchange-rate-history.html) conversion rate on 13 August 2020: 1.1817 USD/EUR. 
This provides the DOT exchange rate of: 105.78 EUR/DOT.
