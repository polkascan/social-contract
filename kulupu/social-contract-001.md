# Social Contract between Kulupu Network and Polkascan Foundation
This Social Contract aims to serve as an agreement between Polkascan Foundation on one hand and the Kulupu Network Community on the other hand. The Social Contract should be viewed as an off-chain coordination mechanism to advance the relation between Kulupu Network Community and Polkascan Foundation in its role of external service provider. The general context of this Social Contract can be found [here](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/README.md).
