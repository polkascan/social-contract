### Appendix: Exchange rate EUR/DOT (old)
The Social Contract states that the KLP base-price will be determined by taking a 30 day average price from major exchanges. 
KLP has only recently been added to exchanges and currently is going through significant volatility and price-discovery.
Hence there is currently no good method to determine fair value of KLP. 
An excahnge rate of 0.50 USD/KLP has been chosen. [Source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kulupu/historical_data/usd?start_date=2020-09-18&end_date=2020-09-18#panel).
